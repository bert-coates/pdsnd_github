# Bert's Bikeshare Analysis Tool (Bert's BAT)

## Description
This script will run analysis on bikeshare data provided as part of the Udacity Python for Data Science Nano Degree course.

## Requirements
This tool was written using Python version 3.6; it may work with other versions, but this has not been tested.

## Instructions for use
To use the tool, simply run the script without any arguments:
`python3 bikeshare.py`

This will launch an interactive session with prompts for user input.

Then provide the required inputs for city, month, and day of week; this will produce a filtered pandas dataframe of the relevant data results to carry out analysis on.

### Date created
